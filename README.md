# Arduino based Manager and a murder mystery game
This is a live action murder mystery game that resembles Werewolf, Mafioso, AmongUs, Dracula and other games where one player is a traitor and others try to catch him. Arduino project is for a Manager that can distribute tasks to players and count time. You don't need it to play the game but if you like to build stuff ... have fun!

# To build the Manager you will need
- Arduino UNO
- LCD screen (I used the one that comes with Arduino started kit, 16x2)
- Four digit display (I used TM1637)
- A button
- Piezo, if you want it to make a sound
- Powersource (I used a power bank with 5V / 2.1A output to make the Manager portable)

# Included are also
- game rules in Finnish
- game rules in English
- .DXF files for making a box with a lasercutter from 3mm acrylic, plywood, what ever you want to use. I did not include a hole for installing the button, because your button might be different size than what I used. 

To be done:
Diagrams for the connections.
