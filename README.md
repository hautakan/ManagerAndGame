# Arduino based Manager and a murder mystery game
This is a live action murder mystery game that resembles Werewolf, Mafioso, AmongUs, Dracula and other games where one player is a traitor and others try to catch him. Arduino project is for a Manager that can distribute tasks to players and count time. Have fun!

![One example of how the Manager could look like](https://github.com/hautakan/ManagerAndGame/blob/main/TheManager.jpg)

# To build the manager you will need
- Arduino UNO
- LCD screen (I used the one that comes with Arduino started kit, 16x2)
- Four digit display (I used TM1637)
- A button
- Piezo, if you want it to make a sound

To be done:
Proper pictures for the connections.
